# Orion Constellations

In this project, we will play the part of an astrophysicist who has the job of visualising constellation data for the Hayden Planetarium in NYC. You'll use Matplotlib to programmatically visualise both 2D and 3D charts, including a 3D scatter plot that maps the x, y, and z coordinates of the Orion constellation.

This will be your first reviewable project, which will give you the opportunity to receive some feedback on what you've learned so far in this Intensive. You will be completing this project on your own computer, similar to the Frida Kahlo project that you did previously. You'll have a week to complete the project, after which you will submit it to a Codecademy Project Reviewer for feedback.
